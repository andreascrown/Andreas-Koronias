## Projects

###  A chaincode in Go providing the following functionality(designed to work in Go playground): 
• Initialization . An NFT can be assigned to a holder. 
• Queries . Given a holder, return the respective NFT(s), if any. Also, given an NFT, return 
the respective holder, if any. 
• Transfer of ownership . The ownership of an NFT can be transferred between two 
entities (from owner to any other person). 
• Lending .  An NFT owner can lend (assume no interest) the NFT to any other 
person for a period of time. After the expiration of that time period the NFT is automatically 
returned to the initial owner.

This project was part of a bigger implementantion in Minifabric.
