##  Featured Projects

### 🔹 ERC20 Staking Contract
A staking smart contract allowing users to stake ERC20 tokens and earn rewards.
- Implements secure reward accounting
- Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind  
➡️ *See repository: `erc20-staking-contract`*

---

### 🔹 Rate-Limited Wallet
A smart contract wallet with **rate-limiting** to mitigate rapid or malicious withdrawals.
- Demonstrates security-first smart contract design
- Useful for custodial and DAO treasury patterns  
➡️ *See repository: `rate-limited-wallet`*

---

### 🔹 Plausible Token Demo
A demo token contract showcasing realistic ERC20 behavior and constraints.
- Focus on clarity and correctness
- Educational and demo-oriented  
➡️ *See repository: `plausible-token`*

---

### 🔹 NFT Chaincode (Hyperledger Fabric – Go)
Chaincode developed as part of my MSc coursework.
**Features:**
- NFT initialization and assignment
- Ownership queries (NFT ↔ holder)
- Ownership transfer
- Time-limited NFT lending with automatic return

Part of a larger **Minifabric** implementation.  
➡️ *See repository: `fabric-nft-chaincode`*
